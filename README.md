# 13/27-image-gallery

This project is all about building a dynamic image gallery that showcases images in a visually appealing and user-friendly way.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/). will use photos from [unsplash.com](unsplash.com).
